# maintenance

**Domain:** facilities
**Kind:** feature
**Status:** planned

Keeps buildings, spaces and equipment working. Anyone reports a fault; maintenance staff triage it, assign it to a technician or vendor, track it against response and resolution targets and record the cost. Preventive schedules raise tickets on their own.

## Scope
Responsible for: ticket categories, tickets (corrective, preventive, inspection) on an asset,
resource, inventory unit or location, assignment to technicians or vendors, SLA tracking, work log
and costs, resolution and reopen, preventive schedules.

Not responsible for: general service requests (`helpdesk`), vendor contracts and AMC renewals
(`amc-vendor-support`), issuing spare parts (`inventory-equipment`), purchasing (`procurement`),
taking a target out of use (its own module, reacting to this module's events).

Requirements: [docs/prd.md](docs/prd.md).
