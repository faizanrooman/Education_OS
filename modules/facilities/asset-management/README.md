# asset-management

**Domain:** facilities
**Kind:** feature
**Status:** planned

Fixed asset register of the organisation: every long-lived, valuable thing it owns, where it is, who holds it, what it cost, what it is worth now and when it was last physically checked.

## Scope
Responsible for: asset categories, the asset register and tags, transfers between locations,
departments and custodians, physical verification cycles (the audit-due widget), depreciation runs,
and disposal with approval.

Not responsible for: lending and stock (`inventory-equipment`), repairs (`maintenance`), buying
(`procurement`), accounting ledgers (finance modules), AMC contracts (`amc-vendor-support`).
Those are linked by reference ids and events, never by foreign keys.

Requirements: [docs/prd.md](docs/prd.md).

## Public surface
- API: [contracts/openapi.yaml](contracts/openapi.yaml)
- Events: [contracts/events.yaml](contracts/events.yaml)
- Permissions: [contracts/permissions.yaml](contracts/permissions.yaml)

## Dependencies
